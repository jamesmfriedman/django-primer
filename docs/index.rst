Primer
==================================

Welcome to Primer's documentation. Primer is intended to be the base coat for your next project. It is a WebDK for making web apps, with all the ground work done for you. What's a WebDK? Well, it's an SDK designed for the web. Primer is here to be your toolbox, and to make your life easier. Primer is a conglomeration of multiple open source frameworks and tools with some custom glue tying it all together. At its core, it leverages the combined powers of Django, jQuery, Bootstrap, and LESS CSS to make for a very powerful development experience.
