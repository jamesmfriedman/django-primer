	<h3>Extension Patterns</h3>
	<p>
		Primer defines a pattern for template extension that relies on convention. The following variables get passed into the template context. They are part of the request.primer dict and can be modified in any view before they ever hit the templates.

		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Template Var</th>
				<th>Location</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>skeleton_template</td>
				<td>primer/skeleton.html</td>
				<td>This is the HTML skeleton for a site. It includes block tags for injecting things into the head of your document and includes all of Primers css and scripts.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>primer_template</td>
				<td>primer/base.html</td>
				<td>Primer base is the general layout of the page. It extends skeleton_template. The default includes a nav, body container, and a footer. This template also gets automatically swapped out for the login page.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>base_template</td>
				<td>base.html</td>
				<td>This should be your default base template for your site. It should extend primer_template. It is useful for filling out blocks in the primer base template, or for doing overrides. If not present, this will default to whatever primer_template is.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>app_template</td>
				<td>appname/base.html</td>
				<td>This template should extend base_template. This wil be a template that is located in a template directory that has the same name as your current app. This is a framing for your app. For instance, if you have an message style app for your site, this might represent that outside message nav and menu, while the content of the individual sections is handled by the view_template. If not present, it defaults to whatever base_template is.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>view_template</td>
				<td>appname/view_name.html</td>
				<td>This is the first point of contact from your view. It should extend app_template. It represents the content of your current view. In the example of the message app, this could be your actual inbox, or a sent messages area.</td>
			</tr>
